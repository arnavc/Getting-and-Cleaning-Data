# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Course Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course

This repository hosts the R code and files necessary to explain the code for The Data Science Track "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The data set being used is here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

#Files

The code takes all the data from the file.

The CodeBook.md file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that were performed to clean up the data. 

run_analysis.R provides the R code that was used to perform the transformations on the data. The code can be launched in RStudio by importing the file.
